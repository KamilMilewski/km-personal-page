      <h1>Galeria Jurowiecka indoor light control</h1>

      <p>
        I took main part in commissioning, programming and created visualization
        for Galeria Jurowiecka(Bia≈Çystok) DALI indoor lighting control.
        DALI stands for Digital Addressable Lighting Interface.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main goal of
        this project is to lower electrical energy consumption and relieve technical
        staff from controlling indoor lighting.
      </p>

      <p>
        It features:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AUTO mode</strong> - program tries to keep constant light density based on
              feedback from indoor sensors</li>
          <li><strong>SCHEDULE</strong> - user can program each lighting zone to switch OFF or ON
              (with given intensity) at given datetime.</li>
          <li><strong>MANUAL mode</strong> - user can have direct control upon each lighting zone
              (ON/OFF, 0-100% light intensity)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
