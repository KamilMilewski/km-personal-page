      <h1>MachPlot</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>MachPlot</strong> has been written as a part master degree thesis: <em>"Steady states in electrical machines - creation of educational application"</em>.
        The subject of the study was to create a program for the presentation of static characteristics of electrical machines.
      </p>

      <p>
        As part of the work two sets of classes were created.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>MachChart</strong> library used to visualize line graph which is a general purpose tool.</li>
          <li><strong>AsynchronousMotor</strong> to calculate the characteristics of the asynchronous machine in steady state.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        On the basis of the two aforementioned class libraries <strong>MachPlot</strong> program was created.
        MachPlot is an application that serves as a teaching aid to study issues related to electrical machines in steady state.
        The program arose from the needs of a tool that possible simply,
        quickly and clearly will be able show at the lecture the impact of changes in the parameters of the mathematical model for the evolution of characteristics.
        The program is designed both for teachers as a teaching aid and a tool for creating new and for students as a self-study.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the main principles underpinning the creation of the program MachPlot was as large as possible susceptibility to modification and upgrades.
        Because of that MachPlot was designed to be consisted of independent application-modules.
